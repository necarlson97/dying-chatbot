# A script for the dying-chatbot to pull responces from
# List the actions in order of their priority 
# 
# You can define subject and action word groups (aka synonomys) in the 'define' section
# A word does not need to be in a group to be used later in the manuscript
### Right now word groups will automatically contain their name
### Right now consider inputs as only alphanum lowercase trimmed
### I think I will also stem everything
### The 'UNKNOWN' dictates the default
### If a user continues asking, it will pop down the list, and repeat the last element
### If an input matches 2, the (higher priority? last in input?) is chosen
### Otherwise, the CLARITY is triggered
### Using {} will trigger a function of the same name
### {sub} will be substituted in for subject
### {tools} will open system tools
